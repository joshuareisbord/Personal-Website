            My name is Joshua Reisbord, and I am an undergraduate student at Queen's University pursuing a 
            bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I started tinkering with tech from a young age and always 
            enjoyed the creativity it allows us as programmers to express! When I transferred to Queen's in the 
            fall of 2018, I thought I wanted to pursue a degree in economics, but I quickly found myself 
            distracted and tinkering with my computer, and from then I knew programming is what I wanted to do 
            for the rest of my life!

            Enough about my re-discovery of my love for programming, more about who I am! In my free time, I always 
            find myself tinkering with programs and testing out ideas which I think about all day, every day 
            (seriously, I daydream about programing). When I am not on the computer, I enjoy my other hobbies like 
            automotive restoration and repair, carpentry, home improvement, surfing, and swimming. I am always up and 
            doing something: rain or shine, sick or not!
